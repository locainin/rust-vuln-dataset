        //   - `slf` is the same pointer as `self`, and `self` is a reference
        //     which points to an object whose size is `len`. Thus...
        //     - The entire region of `len` bytes starting at `slf` is contained
        //       within a single allocation.
        //     - `slf` is non-null.
        //   - `slf` is trivially aligned to `align_of::<u8>() == 1`.
        // - `Self: AsBytes` ensures that all of the bytes of `slf` are
        //   initialized.
        // - Since `slf` is derived from `self`, and `self` is an immutable
        //   reference, the only other references to this memory region that
        //   could exist are other immutable references, and those don't allow
        //   mutation. `AsBytes` prohibits types which contain `UnsafeCell`s,
        //   which are the only types for which this rule wouldn't be sufficient.
        // - The total size of the resulting slice is no larger than
        //   `isize::MAX` because no allocation produced by safe code can be
        //   larger than `isize::MAX`.
        //
